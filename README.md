# Behind the Music

What's truly behind the music? Using Behind the Music, users can upload their audio clips to see its spectral analysis and waveform.

The goal was to create a single page application user React.js for a frontend and a ruby on rails backend api. 

In development, we used D3.js to create waveforms and spectral analysis, Filestack to host the audio clips online, and bcrypt for authentication of each user when they login or out. 

# Concerns and Issues 
- There is plenty of refactoring to be done in order to make cleaner and clearer code.
- Need to incorporate JWT in order to use tokens for user Authentication.
- Would like to build out more D3 for the various audio clips.
